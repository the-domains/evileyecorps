Diamonds attract the eye due to their refractive index 2.417\. The higher the refractive index, the more the light "twinkles". So how high can you go? Optical germanium, mostly used for infrared optics, has a refractive index of 4\. This is one of the highest refractive indexes possible. It should be noted that the sub-1000Â°C melting point of germanium allows for mixture of certain oxides for pigmentation and shape molding. Here, iron oxide (190) provides the red glow. Due to the transmission capabilities of the germanium (a mere 50% transmission), the work has to be coated in an advanced optical coating to ensure superior transmission.
