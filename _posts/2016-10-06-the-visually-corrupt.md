**meh301: everyone should design their own shit**

**Potato: yay chaos**

A creation of the architectural sort, neither based on aesthetic properties, nor on programmable spatial properties. A fully static creation, which evokes a familiarization of the "single", all while evoking the creation of a mass "defamiliarization". Hence the lack of aesthetics within the "non-inertia". Space, in turn, is quite simply a vaguely defined term symbolizing the delimitations of converging programs. Programs which require, at minimum, an individual space. This individual space is replaced with the inert space of a "self". Programs therefore no longer apply and are possibly, not fundamentally required anymore.
