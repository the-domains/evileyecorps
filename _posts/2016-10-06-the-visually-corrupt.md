# The Visually Corrupt

## The view of the ones in the back of the room.

Architectural creation neither based on esthetic properties, nor on programmable spatial properties.

Complete familiarization for the few - complete absence of order for the rest.

which few?

For the single?

**meh301: why isn't architecture art anymore?**

**meh301: my idea won't influence any current architecture ever**

**meh301: there's a large difference between individual and group**

**meh301: im none of the two anymore**

the most inert self

the self that never changes

never changes because

_read-only system._

The expression of the most inert self \[Distinct lack of inertia\]

as an external proposition, impersonal, non-individual, and non-collective.

Full static creation

cf familiarity of the single

**meh301: everyone should design their own shit**

**Potato: yay chaos**

**meh301: IM TALKING ABOUT THE NON-INDIVIDUALISTIC, NON-IMPERSONAL AND NON-COLLECTIVE INERT SELF**

**meh301: READ-ONLY SYSTEM**

A creation of the architectural sort, neither based on aesthetic properties, nor on programmable spatial properties. A fully static creation, which evoke a familiarization of the "single", all while evoking the creation of a mass "defamiliarization". Hence the lack of aesthetics within the "non-inertia". Space, in turn, is quite simply a vaguely defined term symbolizing the delimitations of converging programs. Programs which require, at minimum, an individual space. This individual space is replaced with the inert space of a "self". Programs no longer apply.

This individual space is replaced with the inert space of a "self". Programs therefore no longer apply and are possibly, not fundamentally required anymore. Importance of a read-only system.
